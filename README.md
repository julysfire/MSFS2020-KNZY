###### Description
KNZY Naval Air Station on North Island in San Diego.

###### Summary
This is currently a small project of mine that I will continue work on.

I am currently working on importing custom 3D photorealistic buildings and props to continue to improve this.

This is my first time making anything like this let alone in Flight Sim, will continue to work on this as I learn and go along.  This airport wasn't in the base game but is an active airfield in FSEconomy.
