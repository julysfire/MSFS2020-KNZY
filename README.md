First time making anything like this let alone in Flight Sim, will continue to work on this as I learn and go along.

---Installation Instructions---
1. Download the .zip file from Releases (or julysfire-knzy folder here)
2. Extract files to the your Microsoft Flight Simulator Communities Folder (if you downlaoded just the folder, move just the folder to the Community folder)
  -This folder is defaulted to %AppData%\Local\Packages\Microsoft Flight Simulator_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalCache\Packages\Community\
