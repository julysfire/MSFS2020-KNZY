###### Description
KNZY Naval Air Station on North Island in San Diego.

###### Summary
This is currently a small project of mine that I will continue work on.

This is my first time making anything like this let alone in Flight Sim, will continue to work on this as I learn and go along.  This airport wasn't in the base game but is an active airfield in FSEconomy.
